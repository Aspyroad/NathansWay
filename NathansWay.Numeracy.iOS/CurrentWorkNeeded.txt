1. There is currently a bug in WorkSpace. When a user puts a number into edit mode, and then 
selects next or previous, the control is orphaned in edit mode.
Fix : We need to unselect any edits prior to calling a move next or previous().
Status = FIXED

2. Make all these variables work as expected

        public bool GA__SingleDigitErrorUIDisplay
        public bool GA__PersistUICorrectStateOnMove
        public bool GA__PersistUIInCorrectStateOnMove
        public bool GA__SolveAllNumlets 

3. When you try to reset UI Answer colours after solving it still shows correct/incorrect state
This is a bug caused by the Persist after solved and then move list position UI
